                                        <p>This is a pathetic account of a lady that has ever lived.She recalls the best memories of her life as how she loved eating ice cream located at a shop which was then called<a href="https://nation.com.pk/20-Aug-2013/the-menace-of-terrorism"> the square of heaven </a>.
                                            she said:"in summer my brother would take us there every evening. We would buy ice cream and sit on the grass.It used to be all hustle and bustle,lights and laughter and children playing arround."
                                            This lady at that time was internally displaced in his home town.She picks apples to earn a living and eats one a day herself.
                                            She continued:"it is good for my skin." She said.This lady was orphaned at the age of six and was raised by her brother and his wife,and when she got married, her life was not easier.
                                            She never believed in wearingsuit but after her wedding,her husband forced her to wear one.Worse than that, her new in-laws thought she was too skinny to be considered a real woman, so they convinced her to take cortison pills to put on weight.
                                            She took them for couple of months which caused her to expand like a ballon and feel constantly ill.
                                            In 2015,this lady and her husband had escaped persecution but today the Square Of Heaven no longer sells ice cream-it has become
                                            terorists prefered location for public beheadings and therefore the locals now call it the <a href="https://nation.com.pk/20-Aug-2013/the-menace-of-terrorism">The Square Of Hell</a>.
